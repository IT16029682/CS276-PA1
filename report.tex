\section{System Design}

We followed the structure of the starter code and kept the predefined
interface. To summarize:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Index} class implements the BSBI indexing algorithm
  
  \item \texttt{Query} class implements boolean conjunctive query
  processing algorithm
  
  \item \texttt{BaseIndex} defines the interface for writing/reading
  posting lists
  
  \item \texttt{BasicIndex} class writes uncompressed posting lists
  to/reads posting lists from disk
  
  \item \texttt{VBIndex} writes/reads posting lists with variable byte
  encoding for gaps
  
  \item \texttt{GammaIndex} writes/reads posting lists with gamma encoding
  for gaps
\end{itemize}
There are also some helper classes, e.g. \texttt{ListLengthComparator}
which is used for sorting posting lists when processing the query.

Some key algorithm are explained in detail as follows.

\subsection{Indexing Algorithm}

Key steps in the indexing algorithm are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Process blocks one by one:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For each block, traverse each file and generate \textless Term ID, Doc ID\textgreater{}
    pairs
    
    \item After processing all files in the block, sort the \textless Term ID, Doc ID\textgreater{}
    pairs first by Term ID then by Doc ID and organize pairs with the same
    Term ID into a posting list
    
    \item Create a file and store the posting lists with specified posting
    list writing algorithm
    
    \item Push the file into the merge queue
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Merge blocks into a unified index:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Pop two block files from the queue
    
    \item Merge the postings lists with the same Term ID (if possible) into a
    single one with standard merging algorithm
    
    \item Write merged posting lists into a merged file
    
    \item Push the merged file into the merge queue
    
    \item Proceed until the size of queue is 1
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Write supplemental information (Term to Term ID mapping, Doc Name to
  Doc ID mapping, posting list positions) out to files
\end{enumerate}
The indexing algorithm guarantees that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Term ID and Doc ID are always greater than 0 (so there's no problem for $\gamma$ encoding)
  
  \item When indexing the blocks, only one block is loaded into memory at a
  time
  
  \item When merging two blocks, the indexes are loaded in in a stream
  fashion. That is, for each index to merge, only a posting list is loaded at
  a time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Query Processing Algorithm}

The key steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Split query into terms by whitepsace
  \item Load supplemental information such as \texttt{term.dict}
  \item Load corresponding posting lists from index
  \item Merge posting lists by increasing size
  \item Output result
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{I/O}

We use {\texttt{java.nio}} package for file I/O and mainly rely on
{\texttt{RandomAccessFile}}, {\texttt{FileChannel}} and {\texttt{ByteBuffer}}
classes, which provide byte-level access to files. We
find them useful as we need to record position in file for each posting
list{\footnote{Every time we need to write a posting list, we use the current
position of {\texttt{FileChannel}} as the start position of the posting list in
file.}}. Though low-level, the {\texttt{java.nio}} package offers us finer
control over disk access.

\subsection{Variable Byte Encoding}

A posting list is kept on disk in three parts: Term ID, \#bytes, Doc ID gaps.
We only compress the Doc ID gaps for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Term ID will always occupy 4 bytes and thus can be read
  deterministically when loading. So is for \#bytes.
  
  \item Compressing the Doc ID gaps already gives a huge space saving, and
  further compressing the Term ID and size will only provide trivial space
  saving but complicate loading.
\end{enumerate}
When loading a posting list, Term ID and \#bytes are read in first. With
\#bytes, we can determine how many bytes to read in and then decode the Doc ID
gaps.

\subsection{$\gamma$ Encoding}

A posting list is kept on disk in two parts: \#bits and IDs, where IDs include
Term ID and Doc ID gaps. \#bits is the number of bits after the IDs are
$\gamma$-encoded. \#bits is not encoded and is stored in 4 bytes on disk.

$\gamma$ encoding is a bit more complicated than VB encoding. Writing a
posting list involves:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\gamma$-encode the IDs into a {\texttt{BitSet}}
  
  \item Set \#bits to the number of bits used in the {\texttt{BitSet}}
  
  \item Convert the {\texttt{BitSet}} to a {\texttt{ByteBuffer}} (pad last byte
  with 0 if necessary)
  
  \item Write \#bits and the {\texttt{ByteBuffer}} to file
\end{enumerate}
Similarly, when reading a posting list:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read 4 bytes - it's \#bits
  
  \item Compute \#bytes to read with \#bits{\footnote{See
  {\texttt{GammaIndex.numBytes(int bits)}}.}} and read into a
  {\texttt{ByteBuffer}}
  
  \item Convert the {\texttt{ByteBuffer}} to a {\texttt{BitSet}}
  
  \item $\gamma$-ecode the {\texttt{BitSet}} into integers up to \#bits bits
  
  \item the first integer is the Term ID and the following are the Doc ID gaps
\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance}

\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] In this PA we asked you to use each sub-directory as a block and build
  index for one block at a time. Can you discuss the tradeoff of different
  sizes of blocks? Is there a general strategy when we are working with
  limited memory but want to minimize indexing time?
  
  \textbf{Solution:} Larger blocks would introduce larger memory usage but
  fewer rounds of merges. An extremely large block might not fit into the
  memory such that we cannot do in-memory sort. Similarly, smaller blocks
  would use less memory but lead to more rounds of merges. An too small block
  not only introduces unnecessary rounds of merges but fails to utilize memory
  efficiently.
  
  A proper choice of block size would both fully utilize the memory and reduce
  the rounds of merge. So the block size can be chosen as:
  
  \begin{center}
    block size = total mem - auxiliary information size
  \end{center}
  
  where auiliary information is the {\texttt{termDict}}, {\texttt{docDict}}, etc.
  
  \item[b)] Is there a part of your indexing program that limits its scalability
  to larger datasets? Describe all the other parts of the indexing process
  that you can optimize for indexing time/scalability and retrieval time.
  
  \textbf{Solution:} There are several parts in our implementation which
  limits the scalability:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sub-directory as a block: won't fit into memory if the subdirctory
    is too large
    
    \item global auxiliary information such as {\texttt{termDict}}: linearly
    grows with corpus size and will occupy too much memory, making not enough
    space for block (or even exceed the total memory size)
    
    \item loading the whole posting list into memory at once: if the term is
    too frequent, the posting list will be very large and won't fit into
    memory
  \end{itemize}
  Potential improvements include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item use multi-way merge when merging blocks: will reduce disk I/O
    
    \item choose proper block size according to a)
    
    \item cache auxiliary information (e.g. {\texttt{termDict}}) to reduce
    memory usage
    
    \item load posting list in a buffered way instead of loading the whole
    list
  \end{itemize}
  \item[c)] Any more ideas of how to improve indexing or retrieval performance?
  
  \textbf{Solution:} Ideas include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sort posting lists by size and load a posting list only when it's
    its turn to merge (the current implementation will load posting lists of
    all query terms immediately)
    
    \item use skip list: reduce comparison when merging posting lists
    
    \item compress auxiliary information if it's too large and still keep them
    in memory (no need to do disk I/O)
    
    \item cache query results (good for frequent query)
    
    \item model indexing/retrieval into a distributed system (like what Google
    does)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
